      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    Tkinter provides classes which allow the display, positioning and\n",
      "    control of widgets. Toplevel widgets are Tk and Toplevel. Other\n",
      "    widgets are Frame, Label, Entry, Text, Canvas, Button, Radiobutton,\n",
      "    Checkbutton, Scale, Listbox, Scrollbar, OptionMenu, Spinbox\n",
      "    LabelFrame and PanedWindow.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Properties of the widgets are specified with keyword arguments.\n",
      "    Keyword arguments have the same name as the corresponding resource\n",
      "    under Tk.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Widgets are positioned with one of the geometry managers Place, Pack\n",
      "    or Grid. These managers can be called with methods place, pack, grid\n",
      "    available in every Widget.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Actions are bound to events by resources (e.g. keyword argument\n",
      "    command) or with the method bind.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Example (Hello, World):\n",

      "    tk = tkinter.Tk()\n",
      "    frame = tkinter.Frame(tk, relief=RIDGE, borderwidth=2)\n",

      "    label.pack(fill=X, expand=1)\n",
      "    button = tkinter.Button(frame,text=\"Exit\",command=tk.destroy)\n",
